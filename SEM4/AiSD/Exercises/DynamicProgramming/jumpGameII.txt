You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

0 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

function(X[1..n]):

for i from 2 to n:
    dp[i]=+inf
dp[1]=0

for i from 1 to n:
    int possibleJump = X[i];
    for j from 1 to possibleJump:
        dp[i+j]=min{dp[i]+1, dp[i+j]};

return dp[n];
