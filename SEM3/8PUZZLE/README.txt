This is a simple project I worked on in the last semester.
It explores the famous problem called 8 sliding puzzle problem, which is a simpler version of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle problem we are bound to explore in INA/SEM3 in the near future.

The program contains two heuristics.
The testing phase takes advantage of artificially created states of known depth.
